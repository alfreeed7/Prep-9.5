   <ul>
    <b><li>Soft Skills</li></b>
     <br>
     <ul>
      <li>Collaborating
      <p>The whole syllabus really emphasizes the pair work, which in my opinion highlights the importance of collaboration.</p> 
      <li>Socializing</li>
      <p> Through the process of randomly arranging the deskmate, students can get to know more people. While working with different
      people, the communication skills will be improved. </p>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <p>There is a whole section named “General Rules for Giving/Getting Help” which highlights the importance of having the empathy with
      oursevles. Of course this is about collaboration, but by giving or receiving help, students can know each other better. Because no
      one is able to know everything, we all have the moments that we seek for help, so don’t be stingy. And for many times,those help can be 
      meaningful. In addition, there are a lot of emphasis on the visual interaction, which makes so much sense, because what we learn in
      this class is to present the best to the audience.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
    <b><li>The Self</li></b>
     <p>What I mean the self here means developing oneself and pushing oneself, just like what Mayuko says in the video that there is no
     ending. One should keep improving as there are more in the world waiting for us the discover. And I think that is the reason why
     students need to do more than what they are told to get a higher score.</p>
   </ul>

  <h3>Additional Elements That Can Be Added</h4>
  <ul>
    <b><li>External Sources</li></b>
    <p>There can be some suggested websites for students to use. Because most students are rookies, if there is any resource we can take
      to improve ourselves, that will be great. Also some suggested websites with maybe great, exciting stories of some software engineers,
      whom we can take as role models, will definitely motivate us to do better.<p>
  </ul>
